<p>Greetings! I'm Brandon Ornelas, and I'm on a continuous journey to learn, grow, and be the best I can be in the realm of technology and business management. Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelor of Business Administration in Information Technology at Texas Tech University's Rawls College of Business.

My academic journey has been nothing short of enlightening. Through my coursework in Analytics and Development with Python, I've cultivated not only a basic understanding of Python but also honed my problem-solving abilities. Simultaneously, I'm exploring the intricate world of Data Base Management Systems and Data Communication and Security, expanding my expertise in database management and data communication.

Before embarking on my educational pursuits, I had the privilege of gaining invaluable real-world experience. As a Construction Supervisor at Ornelas' Construction, I orchestrated the planning and execution of home remodeling projects. This role allowed me to collaborate closely with architects, clients, suppliers, and subcontractors, ensuring seamless compliance with rigorous building codes. Subsequently, I transitioned into the financial sector, working as a Bank Teller at Wells Fargo. In this role, I assisted customers with various financial transactions, provided recommendations for credit and loan products, and consistently achieved outstanding customer satisfaction ratings.

My diverse background, rooted in both construction and banking, enriches my professional profile. This multifaceted experience, coupled with my unwavering commitment to ongoing education, underscores my dedication as a well-rounded professional. I bring to the table robust problem-solving skills, effective communication, and adept project management capabilities.

In every endeavor, my aim is to not only excel but to continue evolving. I am steadfast in my pursuit of knowledge, eager to face new challenges, and resolute in my aspiration to make meaningful contributions in the fields of technology and business management.

Let's learn, innovate, and thrive together! ðŸ’¡ðŸš€</p>
